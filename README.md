### Abstract
This project explores the application of the entropy weight method to evaluate green finance indicators across different time periods and regions. The study aims to aid governments in planning for economic development and environmental protection by refining the evaluation of green finance indices. The study used data from the National Bureau of Statistics and local statistical yearbooks spanning 1990 to 2021.

## Methodology

1. **Entropy Weight Method**: The method calculates objective weights for evaluating green finance indicators, factoring in both regional and time-specific characteristics.
2. **Data Normalization**: Before calculation, all indicators are normalized for consistency.
3. **Time-Decay Function**: A time-decay factor is incorporated to give greater weight to more recent data.
4. **Green Finance Indicators**: Indicators used in this analysis include green credit, green investment, green insurance, green bonds, green support, green fund, and green equity.

### Key Concepts:
- **Green Finance**: Financial activities aimed at environmental protection.
- **Entropy Weight Method**: An objective weighting method that minimizes human bias in index calculation.
- **Time-sharing Zone**: Evaluating finance data across different time frames.

## Data

Data were collected from:
- National Bureau of Statistics
- Local statistical yearbooks (1990-2021)

### Green Finance Index Calculation:
The green finance index is calculated using the formula:

```plaintext
S(i,t) = Î£(W_ij * X_ijt') * (time decay factor)
# Results

- The development of green finance between 1990-2021 was divided into three stages:
  - **Starting Period (1990-2000)**
  - **Development Period (2001-2010)**
  - **Stable Period (2011-2021)**

## Key Findings:
- The green finance development across regions was significantly influenced by national policies and regional characteristics.
- Shanghai, Yunnan, and other provinces demonstrated varying growth patterns due to their unique geographical and economic conditions.
